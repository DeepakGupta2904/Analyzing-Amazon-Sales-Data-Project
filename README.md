# Analyzing-Amazon-Sales-Data-Project

Overview:- This project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales data to gain insights into sales trends and identify key metrics and factors that influence sales performance. The objective is to perform ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) operations on the dataset, analyze sales trends (month-wise, year-wise, and yearly-month-wise), and uncover meaningful relationships between different attributes within the data.

Key Tasks:-

1. Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL):-

A. Extract: Load the Amazon sales dataset into Python for analysis. Ensure that the dataset is clean and ready for further processing.

B. Transform: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and apply necessary transformations to the dataset, such as converting date formats and categorizing data.

C. Load: Prepare the transformed data for analysis in Python and Power BI.

2. Sales Trend Analysis:-

A. Month-wise Analysis: Identify sales patterns for each month, highlighting peak and low sales periods.

B. Year-wise Analysis: Compare sales data across different years to identify long-term trends.

C. Yearly Month-wise Analysis: Combine monthly and yearly trends to uncover deeper insights into sales performance.

3. Key Metrics and Relationship Analysis:-

A. Identify and compute key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and sales growth rate.

B. Explore relationships between various attributes, such as product categories, customer segments, and geographical locations, to understand their impact on sales.

C. Use statistical methods and visualizations to highlight significant findings.

4. Visualization and Reporting:-

A. Power BI:-

a. Design and develop an interactive dashboard that displays key metrics and sales trends.

b. Create visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and heat maps to represent sales data effectively.

c. Incorporate filters and drill-down capabilities to allow users to explore the data from different perspectives.

B. Python (Jupyter Notebook):-

a. Write modular, testable, and maintainable code to perform the analysis.

b. Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that complement the Power BI dashboard.

c. Document the entire process, including code, findings, and visualizations, in a well-structured Jupyter Notebook.

Technologies and Tools Used:-

1. Python:- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data manipulation and visualization)
2. Power BI:- (for interactive dashboard creation)
